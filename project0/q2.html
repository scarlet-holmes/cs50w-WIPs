                <p>Welcome to the answer to quibble number two! </p>
				<br>
				<p>The tl;dr version is that on your first weighing, you put three eggs on one side of the scale and three eggs on the other side of the scale, after which you'll know which group of 3 has the rotten egg in it. Of the 3 eggs where you know one is rotten, pick any two and place them each on either side of the scale, after which we'll have found the rotten egg.</p>
				<br>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>Now, if the tl;dr wasn't very helpful, here are some pictures and text to help you out. First, group the nine eggs into three groups of three. Pick any two groups and put them each on the scale. There are three possibilities that could happen</p>
				<div class="media">
					<img src="imgs/q2 - 3 equal.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">Both groups are equal</h5>
							<p>
								This means that all six of these eggs weigh the same, so none of them are the rotten (lighter) egg. This also means the last group of eggs contains the rotton egg.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media">
						<img src="imgs/q2 - 3 left.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">The left group is lighter</h5>
							<p>
								If the left group is lighter than the right group, that means the rotten egg is part of the left (lighter) group and that for the next weighing, we will select an egg from here
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="media">
						<img src="imgs/q2 - 3 right.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">The right group is lighter</h5>
							<p>
								Similar to what we found above, if the right group of eggs is lighter, then the rotten egg must be in here somewhere.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>After finding out which group of 3 has the rotten egg in it, we will now pick any two of the three eggs and put them on either side of the scale. Again, there are three possibilities.</p>
					<div class="media">
						<img src="imgs/q2 - 1 equal.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">They are equal</h5>
							<p>
								If you weigh the two eggs and they are the same weight, then the rotten egg is the only one that we haven't weighed yet! Congrats, we found it!
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media">
						<img src="imgs/q2 - 1 left.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">The left egg is lighter</h5>
							<p>
								Since we know the rotten egg is lighter than the rest, we know that the left egg is the rotten one. *insert party emoji* we got it!
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media">
						<img src="imgs/q2 - 1 right.png" class="mr-3 sizee" alt="...">
						<div class="media-body">
							<h5 class="mt-0">The right egg is lighter</h5>
							<p>
								Similar to what we found above, if the right egg is lighter, then that means well, that the right egg is the rotten one. We got 'em, guys!
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I hope that that all made sense!</p>

					<p>The wonderful scale images were made by yours truly, but I'm not artistic enough to make such a wonderful egg, so if you were wondering, I got the egg from <a href="https://a9effd958e0dc59aaf3b-80520a33cc33a15351bd958c9b8ecc55.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/one-step/graphic-egg.png">this website right here</a></p>
