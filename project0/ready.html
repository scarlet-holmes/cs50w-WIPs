				My little horse must think it queer<br>
				To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
				Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
				The darkest evening of the year.<br>
				
				He gives his harness bells a shake<br> 
				To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
				The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br>
				Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
				
				The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
				But I have promises to keep,<br>
				And miles to go before I sleep,<br>  
				And miles to go before I sleep.
