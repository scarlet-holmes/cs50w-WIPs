                <p>Hello! Welcome to the answer page for the sixth problem! This one was more of a math problem, but if you read the question carefully, I'm sure you'll reach the answer eventually. But you're here 'cause there's probably much more interesting things to do than work out math problems. </p>
				<br>
				<p>So we know that each coin weighs 10 units and that bag 1 has 1 coin in it, bag 2 has two coins in it, and so on. If we work it out, this means, if all the coins were real, the total weight of these five bags would be 10+20+30+40+50 = 150 units. However, since there is one bag filled with fake coins, the total will be less than 150. How much less? Well, that's the answer! When we weigh all the bags at once, the expected weight (150) - the actual weight will be equal to one of the bag numbers, which will tell us which bag is the one filled with fake coins.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Not satisfied? Well let's test it and see. Let's say bag 3 is full of fake coins. A fake coin weighs one unit less than a real coin, so it weighs 9 units. If we add up all the bags 10+20+(3*9)+40+50 we get 147, which is 3 less than 150. The reason this works is because 1) the number of coins in a bag correspond with the bag number and 2) because the fake coins are one unit less than a real coin. When we weigh them together, we're basically subtracting 1 unit for each fake coin there is, which tells us the bag number!</p>
